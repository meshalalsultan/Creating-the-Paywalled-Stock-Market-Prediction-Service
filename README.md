# Creating-the-Paywalled-Stock-Market-Prediction-Service
In our final ML-to-WebApp project, we will create a stock market prediction application behind a real paywall service. We will apply the power of TensorFlow, a high-performance numerical computation framework, on stock market data to offer predictions of future prices.  In this hypothetical application, viewers will have to purchase subscriptions for your service through the powerful web plugin Memberful.com. This is a critical point I can't emphasize enough, whenever you are dealing with sensitive data that isn't your main business, push that work onto others that do specialize in it. The last thing you want is to be responsible for stolen customer data. Here, I will show you a great way to monetize your business without unnecessary risks in a fully professional ecosystem.
